# Postman API practice

This repository contains structured examples and demonstrations of API requests, testing methodologies, scripts, and environments using Postman. This project showcases API testing practices using various API endpoints.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into five main folders:

### 1. Basic API Requests
- Definition and examples of HTTP methods: **GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE**.
- Understanding request structure and responses.

### 2. Functional and Performance Testing
- Execution of test runs for functional and performance testing.
- Comparison of test runs for different testing scenarios.

### 3. Pre-Request Scripts & Variables
- Explanation of pre-request scripts in Postman for **GET** requests.
- Definition and usage of variables (*local, collection, environment, global*).
- Demonstrations of dynamic variable assignment.

### 4. Post-Request Response Handling
- Implementing post-response scripts for handling API responses in **POST** requests.

### 5. Environments & Data Manipulation
- Demonstration of changing endpoint data based on the selected environment for **POST** requests.
- Configuring environment-specific values and variables in Postman.

### 6. Exported Postman Collection
- This folder contains JSON file of the Postman Collection.

## How to Use

1. Copy and import the JSON file  
2. Open the Postman collections and start exploring the API requests and testing features.
3. Modify environment variables as per your requirements.
4. Run test cases and compare results for functional and performance testing.

## Prerequisites

- **Postman** installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of API request methods and testing concepts.

## Future plans
- This is a work in progress.
- In the future, I plan to expand this project with additional materials.
